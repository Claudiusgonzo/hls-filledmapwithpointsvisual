## Starter Kit Challenge

1. Healthcare organization wants to build a Power BI dashboard that incorporates a map that colors states and counties based on COVID infection counts.
2. Healthcare organization wants to add a 'pin' to the location of care centers (e.g. hospitals) based on latitude / longitude so they can see how "hot spots" align to their care centers.
3. Healthcare organization wants a tooltip on each state / county that shows # infected, # fatalities, and # recovered.

## Expected Skills & Technologies
